**Arbitrage** - возможность перепродавать товар с разными ценами на разных рынках

==Law of One Price==: if equivalent investment opportunities trade simultaneously in different competitive markets, then they must trade for the same price in both markets. 
(на разных рынках одинаковые цены)

==Competitive market==: the good can be bough and sold at the same price by anyone.
(маленький спред)

==Valuation Principle==: The value of an asset is determined by its competitive market price (today value). The benefits and costs of a decision should be evaluated using these market prices.

**Time value of money** difference in value between money today and money in the future.

 **Risk-free interest rate** (Справедливая ставка процента, ставка дисконтирования) $r_f$ interest rate at which money can be borrowed or lent without risk over a period (typically a year).

**Interest rate factor** for risk-free cash flows is $1 + r_f$ , how many dollars in the future are worth one dollar today

**Discount Factor** is $\frac{1}{1 + r_f}$ , and **discount rate** is  $r_f$ .

One year rate of return $r = \frac{FV - PV}{PV}$

Negative r: (работает с безналичными деньгами без кэша)
- deflation
- stimulation

Net Present Value (NPV)= Present Value (PV) of benefits minus costs.

**Portfolio** is a combination of securities. Take securities A and B, then a portfolio C can be any collection of As and Bs.

$P_C$ = Price(A+B) = $P_A$ +$P_B$.
